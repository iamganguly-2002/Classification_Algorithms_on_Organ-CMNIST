# Classification_Algorithms_on_Organ-CMNIST

Various Classification Algorithms on OrganCMNIST dataset and thier performance comaprison ( Algorithms are without using deep learning)

The OrganCMNIST dataset is open-source and can be accessed through the MedMNIST Python library or directly from its GitHub repository. For more details visit MedMNIST website (https://medmnist.com/).

The complete dataset contains 23,583 images, divided as follows: the training set includes 12,975 images, the validation set contains 2,392 images, and the test set comprises 8,216 images. Each dataset is processed to extract images and their corresponding labels: • The images are stored as 2D arrays (28x28 pixels). • The labels represent the organ class corresponding to each image.

Objectives of the project:- • To apply and evaluate traditional multiple multiclass classification algorithms without employing deep learning techniques on the OrganCMNIST dataset. • To compare the performance of these algorithms using standard evaluation metrics. • To conduct binary classification using masked data to explore its potential impact on model performance.
